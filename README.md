# Titanic-Data-Set
<h1> Analying the titanic dataset </h1>

<p> I used different methods of classification and formed an ensemble with them to create a model to predict survivors from the Titanic data set. The models I used were:
  <li> DecisionTress</li>
  <li> RandomForest</li>
  <li> ExtraTrees </li>
  <li> AdaBoost</li>
  <li> SVC </li>
  
The Jupyter notebook documents my thought process and the importance of each feature in each model.
